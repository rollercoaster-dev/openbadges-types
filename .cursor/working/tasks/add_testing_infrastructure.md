# Add Testing Infrastructure

## Branch: `feat/add-testing-infrastructure`

## 1. Goal and Context
- **Objective:** Implement a comprehensive testing framework for the OpenBadges Types package
- **Energy Level:** Medium ðŸ”‹
- **Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

### Context and Background
The OpenBadges Types package currently has basic test files but lacks a formal testing framework. Adding proper testing infrastructure will ensure type definitions correctly match the OpenBadges 2.0 and 3.0 specifications and provide confidence in the package's reliability.

Testing is particularly important for a types package to ensure that the types accurately represent the specifications and that they work as expected in real-world usage scenarios.

### Key Design Decisions
- Use Jest as the testing framework for its simplicity and wide adoption
- Implement both type checking tests and runtime validation tests
- Structure tests to mirror the package organization (v2, v3, shared)

## 2. Resources and Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** 
  - Node.js and npm installed
  - OpenBadges Types package repository cloned
- **Existing Tools/Files:** 
  - `test/ob2.test.ts` - Basic tests for OpenBadges 2.0
  - `test/ob3.test.ts` - Basic tests for OpenBadges 3.0
- **Additional Needs:** 
  - Jest and related dependencies
  - TypeScript configuration for Jest

### Related Code Sections
- `src/v2/index.ts` - OpenBadges 2.0 type definitions
- `src/v3/index.ts` - OpenBadges 3.0 type definitions
- `src/shared/` - Shared type definitions
- `package.json` - For adding test scripts and dependencies

## 3. Planning
### Current Status
- [x] Basic test files created
- [ ] Testing framework installed
- [ ] Test scripts added to package.json
- [ ] Comprehensive test cases implemented
- [ ] CI integration for automated testing

### Quick Wins
- [ ] Add Jest and ts-jest dependencies (5 mins)
- [ ] Create Jest configuration file (5 mins)

### Implementation Plan
1. Set up Jest with TypeScript support - 30 mins ðŸŽ¯
   - Install Jest, ts-jest, and @types/jest
   - Create jest.config.js file
   - Add test scripts to package.json
2. Enhance existing tests - 2 hours ðŸŽ¯
   - Convert existing tests to Jest format
   - Add assertions instead of console.log statements
   - Organize tests into describe/it blocks
3. Add comprehensive test cases - 3 hours ðŸŽ¯
   - Add type checking tests using TypeScript's type system
   - Add validation tests for all major types
   - Test edge cases and optional properties
4. Set up CI integration - 1 hour ðŸŽ¯
   - Create GitHub Actions workflow for testing
   - Configure test reporting

## 4. Technical Details
### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual type definitions
- Integration tests for type compatibility between versions
- Type checking tests to ensure TypeScript compiler catches errors

Test cases to cover:
1. Validation of required properties for all major types
2. Correct handling of optional properties
3. Type compatibility between related types
4. Proper handling of JSON-LD context and types
5. Version-specific operations using helper types

### Rollback Plan
- Keep original test files until new tests are fully implemented
- Use git to revert changes if needed

### Definition of Done
- All tests pass successfully
- Test coverage is at least 80%
- CI pipeline is set up and running tests on each commit
- Documentation is updated with testing information

## 5. Execution and Progress
### Progress Updates
- [ ] Step One: Set up Jest with TypeScript
- [ ] Step Two: Enhance existing tests

### Context Resume Point
- Last working on: Initial planning
- Next planned action: Install Jest and related dependencies
- Current blockers: None

### Next Actions & Blockers
- **Immediate Next Actions:** 
  - [ ] Install Jest and related dependencies (15 mins)
  - [ ] Create Jest configuration file (15 mins)
- **Current Blockers:**
  - None identified

## 6. Reflection and Learning
### Decision Log
- **Decision:** Use Jest as the testing framework
  - **Reasoning:** Jest is widely adopted, has good TypeScript support, and is easy to set up
  - **Alternatives:** Mocha+Chai, AVA

### Learnings
- Testing type definitions requires a different approach than testing runtime code
- Type-level testing in TypeScript can be achieved using conditional types and inference

### User Experience
- **Friction Points:** None yet identified
- **Flow Moments:** None yet identified
- **Celebration Notes:** ðŸŽ‰ Repository successfully set up

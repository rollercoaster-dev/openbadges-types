# Enhance Type Safety

## Branch: `feat/enhance-type-safety`

## 1. Goal and Context
- **Objective:** Improve type safety and validation capabilities in the OpenBadges Types package
- **Energy Level:** High ðŸ”‹
- **Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

### Context and Background
While the OpenBadges Types package provides TypeScript definitions, it could benefit from enhanced type safety features and runtime validation capabilities. This would help developers catch errors earlier and ensure their implementations conform to the OpenBadges specifications.

Adding more type guards, branded types, and potentially runtime validation would make the package more robust and user-friendly.

### Key Design Decisions
- Add more type guards for type narrowing
- Implement branded types for IRI and DateTime
- Consider adding runtime validation using Zod or io-ts
- Maintain backward compatibility

## 2. Resources and Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** 
  - OpenBadges Types package repository cloned
  - Understanding of TypeScript advanced type features
- **Existing Tools/Files:** 
  - `src/shared/jsonld.ts` - Contains existing type guards
  - `src/v2/index.ts` and `src/v3/index.ts` - Main type definitions
- **Additional Needs:** 
  - Potentially Zod or io-ts for runtime validation

### Related Code Sections
- `src/shared/common.ts` - Contains basic types like IRI and DateTime
- `src/shared/jsonld.ts` - JSON-LD related types and guards
- `src/v2/index.ts` - OpenBadges 2.0 type definitions
- `src/v3/index.ts` - OpenBadges 3.0 type definitions

## 3. Planning
### Current Status
- [x] Basic type definitions implemented
- [x] Some type guards available (isJsonLdObject)
- [ ] Branded types for IRI and DateTime
- [ ] Comprehensive type guards for all major types
- [ ] Runtime validation capabilities

### Quick Wins
- [ ] Add isIRI type guard function (10 mins)
- [ ] Add isDateTime type guard function (10 mins)

### Implementation Plan
1. Implement branded types - 1 hour ðŸŽ¯
   - Create branded types for IRI and DateTime
   - Update existing types to use branded types
   - Ensure backward compatibility
2. Add comprehensive type guards - 2 hours ðŸŽ¯
   - Create type guards for all major types
   - Add helper functions for type narrowing
   - Document usage of type guards
3. Implement runtime validation (optional) - 3 hours ðŸŽ¯
   - Evaluate Zod and io-ts
   - Implement validation schemas
   - Create validation helper functions
4. Update documentation and examples - 1 hour ðŸŽ¯
   - Document new type safety features
   - Add examples of using type guards and validation

## 4. Technical Details
### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for type guards
- Type-level tests for branded types
- Integration tests for validation functions

Test cases to cover:
1. Type guards correctly identify valid and invalid objects
2. Branded types provide proper type safety
3. Validation functions catch specification violations
4. Backward compatibility is maintained

### Rollback Plan
- Keep original types alongside enhanced types until fully tested
- Use feature flags for new capabilities
- Provide migration path for users

### Definition of Done
- All planned type guards are implemented and tested
- Branded types are added for IRI and DateTime
- Runtime validation is implemented (if decided)
- Documentation is updated with new features
- Examples demonstrate the enhanced type safety

## 5. Execution and Progress
### Progress Updates
- [ ] Step One: Implement branded types
- [ ] Step Two: Add comprehensive type guards

### Context Resume Point
- Last working on: Initial planning
- Next planned action: Implement branded types for IRI and DateTime
- Current blockers: None

### Next Actions & Blockers
- **Immediate Next Actions:** 
  - [ ] Create branded type for IRI (20 mins)
  - [ ] Create branded type for DateTime (20 mins)
- **Current Blockers:**
  - None identified

## 6. Reflection and Learning
### Decision Log
- **Decision:** Consider adding runtime validation
  - **Reasoning:** Runtime validation provides an additional layer of safety beyond compile-time checks
  - **Alternatives:** Rely solely on TypeScript's type system

### Learnings
- Branded types provide nominal typing in TypeScript's structural type system
- Type guards enable better type narrowing and safer code

### User Experience
- **Friction Points:** None yet identified
- **Flow Moments:** None yet identified
- **Celebration Notes:** ðŸŽ‰ Repository successfully set up

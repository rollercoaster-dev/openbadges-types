# Improve Developer Experience

## Branch: `feat/improve-developer-experience`

## 1. Goal and Context
- **Objective:** Enhance the developer experience for contributors and users of the OpenBadges Types package
- **Energy Level:** Medium ðŸ”‹
- **Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

### Context and Background
A good developer experience is crucial for both contributors to the package and developers using it. By adding linting, formatting, and additional npm scripts, we can make the codebase more consistent and easier to work with.

These improvements will help maintain code quality, reduce errors, and make it easier for new contributors to get started with the project.

### Key Design Decisions
- Add ESLint for code linting
- Add Prettier for code formatting
- Enhance npm scripts for common tasks
- Create a streamlined development workflow

## 2. Resources and Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** 
  - OpenBadges Types package repository cloned
  - Node.js and npm installed
- **Existing Tools/Files:** 
  - `package.json` - For scripts and dependencies
  - `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- **Additional Needs:** 
  - ESLint configuration
  - Prettier configuration
  - Additional npm scripts

### Related Code Sections
- `package.json` - For adding scripts and dependencies
- `.eslintrc.js` - ESLint configuration (to be created)
- `.prettierrc` - Prettier configuration (to be created)
- `src/` - Source code to be linted and formatted

## 3. Planning
### Current Status
- [x] Basic package.json with build script
- [x] TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Linting configuration
- [ ] Formatting configuration
- [ ] Enhanced npm scripts

### Quick Wins
- [ ] Add .editorconfig file (5 mins)
- [ ] Add npm script for clean build (5 mins)

### Implementation Plan
1. Set up ESLint - 1 hour ðŸŽ¯
   - Install ESLint and TypeScript plugins
   - Create ESLint configuration
   - Add lint script to package.json
2. Set up Prettier - 30 mins ðŸŽ¯
   - Install Prettier
   - Create Prettier configuration
   - Add format script to package.json
3. Enhance npm scripts - 1 hour ðŸŽ¯
   - Add scripts for common tasks
   - Create combined scripts for development workflow
   - Document scripts in README
4. Add development documentation - 1 hour ðŸŽ¯
   - Create DEVELOPMENT.md with workflow instructions
   - Document development environment setup
   - Add troubleshooting section

## 4. Technical Details
### Testing Strategy
- Verify linting catches common issues
- Test formatting on sample files
- Validate npm scripts work as expected

Test cases to cover:
1. Linting identifies code issues
2. Formatting produces consistent code style
3. npm scripts execute correctly
4. Development workflow is smooth and intuitive

### Rollback Plan
- Keep original files until new configuration is fully tested
- Document manual steps for tasks automated by scripts

### Definition of Done
- ESLint is configured and working
- Prettier is configured and working
- npm scripts are added and documented
- Development documentation is created
- All source code passes linting and formatting checks

## 5. Execution and Progress
### Progress Updates
- [ ] Step One: Set up ESLint
- [ ] Step Two: Set up Prettier

### Context Resume Point
- Last working on: Initial planning
- Next planned action: Install ESLint and create configuration
- Current blockers: None

### Next Actions & Blockers
- **Immediate Next Actions:** 
  - [ ] Install ESLint and plugins (15 mins)
  - [ ] Create ESLint configuration (30 mins)
- **Current Blockers:**
  - None identified

## 6. Reflection and Learning
### Decision Log
- **Decision:** Use ESLint and Prettier together
  - **Reasoning:** ESLint provides code quality checks while Prettier handles formatting, creating a comprehensive solution
  - **Alternatives:** TSLint (deprecated), StandardJS

### Learnings
- Automated tools reduce cognitive load for developers
- Consistent code style improves readability and maintainability

### User Experience
- **Friction Points:** None yet identified
- **Flow Moments:** None yet identified
- **Celebration Notes:** ðŸŽ‰ Repository successfully set up

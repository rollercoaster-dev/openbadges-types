# Setup Publishing Workflow

## Branch: `feat/setup-publishing-workflow`

## 1. Goal and Context
- **Objective:** Establish a robust publishing workflow for the OpenBadges Types package
- **Energy Level:** Medium ðŸ”‹
- **Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

### Context and Background
To ensure the OpenBadges Types package can be reliably published to npm and maintained over time, a proper publishing workflow needs to be established. This includes setting up continuous integration, automated testing, version management, and release processes.

A well-defined publishing workflow will make it easier to maintain the package, ensure quality, and provide a smooth experience for users who depend on the package.

### Key Design Decisions
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Implement semantic versioning
- Automate the release process
- Add quality checks before publishing

## 2. Resources and Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** 
  - OpenBadges Types package repository set up
  - GitHub repository permissions
  - npm account with publishing rights
- **Existing Tools/Files:** 
  - `package.json` - For version management and scripts
  - `.gitignore` - For excluding files from the repository
- **Additional Needs:** 
  - GitHub Actions workflow files
  - Release configuration
  - npm configuration

### Related Code Sections
- `package.json` - For scripts and version management
- `.github/workflows/` - For GitHub Actions configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - For build configuration

## 3. Planning
### Current Status
- [x] Basic package.json configuration
- [x] Repository set up on GitHub
- [ ] CI/CD workflow established
- [ ] Release process defined
- [ ] npm publishing configured

### Quick Wins
- [ ] Add npm version and license badges to README (5 mins)
- [ ] Create .npmignore file (5 mins)

### Implementation Plan
1. Set up GitHub Actions for CI - 1 hour ðŸŽ¯
   - Create workflow for running tests
   - Add linting and type checking
   - Configure build verification
2. Configure semantic versioning - 30 mins ðŸŽ¯
   - Add commitlint for conventional commits
   - Set up version management
3. Establish release process - 1 hour ðŸŽ¯
   - Create release workflow
   - Configure changelog generation
   - Set up GitHub releases
4. Configure npm publishing - 30 mins ðŸŽ¯
   - Set up npm authentication
   - Configure package publishing
   - Add publication safeguards

## 4. Technical Details
### Testing Strategy
- Verify CI workflow by making test commits
- Test release process with a pre-release version
- Validate npm package by installing from the registry

Test cases to cover:
1. CI workflow runs on pull requests
2. Tests pass before merging
3. Release process creates proper tags and releases
4. npm package is published correctly

### Rollback Plan
- Keep manual publishing option as a backup
- Document rollback procedures for failed releases
- Use npm unpublish for problematic package versions (within time limits)

### Definition of Done
- CI/CD workflow is established and working
- Release process is automated and tested
- npm publishing is configured and verified
- Documentation includes information about the release process

## 5. Execution and Progress
### Progress Updates
- [ ] Step One: Set up GitHub Actions for CI
- [ ] Step Two: Configure semantic versioning

### Context Resume Point
- Last working on: Initial planning
- Next planned action: Create GitHub Actions workflow
- Current blockers: None

### Next Actions & Blockers
- **Immediate Next Actions:** 
  - [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow file (30 mins)
  - [ ] Add test and build jobs (30 mins)
- **Current Blockers:**
  - None identified

## 6. Reflection and Learning
### Decision Log
- **Decision:** Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD
  - **Reasoning:** Tight integration with GitHub, free for open source, powerful workflows
  - **Alternatives:** Travis CI, CircleCI, Jenkins

### Learnings
- Automated workflows save time and reduce human error
- Semantic versioning helps users understand the impact of updates

### User Experience
- **Friction Points:** None yet identified
- **Flow Moments:** None yet identified
- **Celebration Notes:** ðŸŽ‰ Repository successfully set up
